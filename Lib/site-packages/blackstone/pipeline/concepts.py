class Concepts:
    """
    A custom pipeline component for identifying legal "concepts"
    in the doc. 

    This process is rules-based as opposed to statistical. 

    The doc is processed as usual, the EntityRuler is applied to the
    end of the pipeline, the patterns to look for are added to
    the ruler, matches are identified in the doc and are labelled 
    as CONCEPT entities. 

    The concept pipe is added after the EntityRuler and the concepts
    in the doc are accessible via doc._.concepts as a Counter object.
    
    Usage:
    concepts_pipe = Concepts(nlp)
    nlp.add_pipe(concepts_pipe)
